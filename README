PACKAGE-RENAMING

This library allows you to locally rename CL packages.


==== Exported Functionality ====

The package-renaming library creates a package PACKAGE-RENAMING,
that exports the following macros and functions:

check-same-package-names
check-package-candidate-names
package-names
find-package-from-names
effect-package-renaming
effect-package-renamings
call-with-package-renamings
with-package-renamings

NB: All this is only safe when package operations are single-threaded.

==== TO DO ====

1- document it

2- write tests

3- document how to use it with ASDF

4- make it work when there are non-trivial overlaps
  between old names and new names

5- write more tests
